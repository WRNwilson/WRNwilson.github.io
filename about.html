						<h1>A Little About Me</h1>
					</header>
					<span class="image main"><img src="images/8.jpg" alt="" /></span>
					<p>Fast forwarding through much of the early associates in engineering bits, I essentially started
						out as a math person. I loved it (and still very much do), I loved it so much that, it was all
						I wanted to do. Working with my professors, doing research, a bunch of fancy upper division
						electives (partial differential equations, nonlinear physics, mathematical modelling, etc.),
						all in the hopes of going on to do my PhD in mathematical modelling.
					</p>
					<p>As a STEM major I then realized that there was a massive gap in my knowledge, a gap that if left
						unfilled would prove itself to be deeply hindering, especially given the current age in which we
						live. I had the S, E, and the M, the missing skill was the T, i.e. proficiency in a coding
						language. All my years of academia and not once was I told of the amazing utility of being able
						to code.
					</p>
					<p>Realizing my gross lack in computer science knowledge, I then set out to teach myself Python, and
						in a relatively short space of time gained enough knowledge (Stackoverflow was a huge resource)
						to tackle my first data science project, with the help of Kaggle. I did some pretty cool
						projects, like working on a NBA player dataset and looking at the relationship between their
						height, weight, and what position they play. I also did a deep learning project using LSTM (long
						short term memory) to train a model to ‘rap’.
					</p>
					<p>
						In order to jump start my computer science knowledge (as a developer) I sought out a mentor,
						someone to help with my software engineering skills (JS, CSS, HTML, React, etc.). I have really
						fallen in love with coding, and I have big plans to fully merge my mathematical background with
						software engineering so stay tuned!!!
